Computational Practices Homework 5
Problems I found:
(1) in pong.js: none of my input keys worked when I typed in the functions for the code. I don't think I wrote them correctly.
(2) in diamond-lines.js: I didn't know how to rotate the rectangle at an angle and find the right coordinates for it.
(3) in taller-lines.js: the code isn't exactly like the reference photo but I know you can make the increment smaller for
    lines to appear.
(4) in lewitt-368.js: I didn't know how to make horizontal lines only appear in the ellipse.
